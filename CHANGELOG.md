=========

###0.3.0 (06/10/16)
* Made compatible with Lua 5.3

* Strict/unstrict rules are now applied per table (or environnement).
* Strict mode enforces variable declarations and complain on undefined fields access/assignment.
* Tables (or environnements) already existing metatables are preserved, including `__index` and `__newindex` fields.
* Added `strictness.strict` to convert a normal table (or environnement) to a strict one.
* Added `strictness.unstrict` to convert a strict table (or environnement) to a normal one.
* Added `strictness.is_strict` to check if a table (or environnement) is strict.
* Added `strictness.strictf` to wrap a normal function into a non strict function.
* Added `strictness.unstrictf` to wrap a normal function into a strict function.
* Added `strictness.run_strict` to run a normal function in strict mode.
* Added `strictness.run_unstrict` to run a normal function in non strict mode.
* Made compliant with Lua 5.2 new _ENV lexical scoping (although strictly speaking there are no globals in Lua 5.2).
