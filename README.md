With the __Lua__ programming language, undeclared variables are not detected until runtime, as Lua will not complain when loading code.
This is releated to the convention that Lua uses : [global by default](http://www.lua.org/pil/1.2.html). In other words, when a variable is not recognized as *local*, it will be
interpreted as a *global* one, and will involve a lookup in the global environment `_G` (for Lua 5.1). Note that this behaviour has been removed starting from Lua 5.2, which strictly speaking has no globals, because of its [lexical scoping](http://www.luafaq.org/#T8.2.1).

*strictness* is a module to track *access and assignment* to undefined variables in your code. It *enforces* to declare globals and modules variables before
assigning them values. As such, it helps having a better control on the scope of variables across the code.

*strictness* is mostly meant to work with Lua [5.1](http://www.lua.org/versions.html#5.1), but it is compatible with newer versions of Lua.
